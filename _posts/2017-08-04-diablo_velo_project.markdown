Side project that mines cycling data from [Strava's API](https://strava.github.io/api/) to analyze cycling efforts on the popular Bay Area mountain-climbing segment [Diablo - North Gate to Summit](https://www.strava.com/segments/656860). Uses performance data from over 23,000 rides and weather data scraped from [Weather Underground](http://wunderground.com) to predict cyclists' moving time up the mountain. Built with the following Python tools (among others):

- pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- seaborn
- BeautifulSoup
