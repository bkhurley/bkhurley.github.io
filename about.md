I am a PhD student at the University of California Davis' [Center for Mind and Brain](http://mindbrain.ucdavis.edu), where I study in the [Janata Lab](https://atonal.ucdavis.edu). My research uses a combination of body movement recordings, psychophysics, computational modeling, and subjective ratings to examine the intersection between attention, sound-movement synchronization, and pleasure in human listeners.

As I approach the end of my PhD, I am preparing a transition to industry, ideally as a quantitative user researcher or data scientist.

When I am not am not designing experiments, coding, analyzing data, or writing, you can find me rolling on two wheels through the hilly roads of the San Francisco Bay Area.

Find me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/bkhurley/) and [Github](https://github.com/bkhurley), or [email](hurley.brian@gmail.com) me. If you like cycling, you can also find me on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/4699116).
