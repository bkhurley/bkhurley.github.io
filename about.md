I am a PhD student in the [Janata Lab](https://atonal.ucdavis.edu) at the University of California Davis' [Center for Mind and Brain](http://mindbrain.ucdavis.edu). My research uses body movement recordings, psychophysics, and computational modeling to examine how humans deploy their attention to and synchronize their body movements with the sounds that they hear, particularly in the context of music.

As I approach the end of my PhD, I am preparing a transition to industry, ideally as a user researcher, data scientist, or some combination of the two (e.g., quantitative user research).

When I am not am not designing experiments, coding, analyzing data, or writing, you can find me rolling on two wheels through the hilly roads of the San Francisco Bay Area.
