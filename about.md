## Brian Hurley
*Data Science Fellow at [Insight Data Science](https://insightdatascience.com)*

### About Me
I am a cognitive scientist with a keen interest in solving practical problems and impacting society using data. As of January 2018, I am a Data Science Fellow at [Insight Data Science](https://insightdatascience.com), an intensive seven-week post-doctoral training fellowship to facilitate the transition from academia to data science. 

In January 2018 I completed my PhD in the [Perception, Cognition, and Cognitive Neuroscience](http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/graduate/graduate-program/areas-of-specialization/perception-cognition-and-cognitive-neuroscience) area of the [University of California Davis'](https://www.ucdavis.edu/) Psychology Department, where I worked in the lab of [Petr Janata](https://atonal.ucdavis.edu). My PhD research used body movement recordings, psychophysics, and computational modeling to examine how human listeners perceive and synchronize body movements with the timing structure of rhythmic sounds, namely music. I received my BA from the [University of Texas at Dallas](http://www.utdallas.edu) in the [School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences](http://www.utdallas.edu/bbs/), where I performed research on the perception and memory of musical patterns under the guidance of [Jay Dowling](https://www.utdallas.edu/bbs/faculty/detail.php5?i=171).

When I am not designing experiments, programming, or crunching data, you can find me rolling on two wheels through the hilly roads of the San Francisco Bay Area.
