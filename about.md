## Brian Hurley
*Data Scientist | Cognitive Scientist*

### About Me
I am a Data Scientist on Apple's People Analytics team. Before Apple, I held people data science roles at [Humu](https://humu.com/) -- a startup founded by founded by [Laszlo Bock](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laszlobock/) of [*Work Rules*](https://www.amazon.com/Work-Rules-Insights-Inside-Transform-ebook/dp/B00MEMMVB8) fame -- and Facebook. I was also a Data Science Fellow at [Insight](https://www.insightdatascience.com/).

Prior to industry, I completed a Ph.D. in Cognitive Psychology/Cognitive Neuroscience at UC Davis' [Center for Mind and Brain](https://mindbrain.ucdavis.edu/), where I worked on computational models and experimental testing of how the brain processes sound (using music, to be exact). 

Aside from work, I spend as much time as possible with my wife and two young, toddler-age daughters. I also love cycling, but I do much less of it these days than I used to. I also love coffee, which I drink much more of these days than I used to.

Find me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/bkhurley/) and [Github](https://github.com/bkhurley), or [email](mailto:hurley.brian@gmail.com) me. If you like cycling, you can also find me on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/4699116).
