## Brian Hurley
*Graduate Student Researcher and PhD Candidate in the [Janata Lab](https://atonal.ucdavis.edu) at the University of California Davis' [Center for Mind and Brain](http://mindbrain.ucdavis.edu)*

### About Me
I am a grad student at the final stage of my PhD in the [Perception, Cognition, and Cognitive Neuroscience](http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/graduate/graduate-program/areas-of-specialization/perception-cognition-and-cognitive-neuroscience) area of the [University of California Davis'](https://www.ucdavis.edu/) Psychology Department. My PhD research uses body movement recordings, psychophysics, and computational modeling to examine how human listeners deploy their attention to and synchronize their body movements with the sounds that they hear. I explore these questions with experiments using music, as music provides a rich acoustic environment that individuals naturally engage with. I received my BA from the [University of Texas at Dallas](http://www.utdallas.edu) in the [School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences](http://www.utdallas.edu/bbs/), where I performed research on the perception and memory of musical patterns under the guidance of [Dr. Jay Dowling](https://www.utdallas.edu/bbs/faculty/detail.php5?i=171).

I am also keenly interested in predictive analytics and solving problems with data (check out my data-related side projects [here](https://bkhurley.github.io/projects/)). In January 2018, I will begin my new role as a Data Science Fellow at [Insight Data Science](http://insightdatascience.com) in Palo Alto, California. 

When I am not designing experiments, programming, crunching data, or writing my dissertation, you can find me rolling on two wheels through the hilly roads of the San Francisco Bay Area.
