<p>I am a PhD student at the University of California Davis' Center for Mind and Brain, where I study in the [Janata Lab](https://atonal.ucdavis.edu). My research uses a combination of body movement recordings, psychophysics, computational modeling, and subjective ratings to examine the intersection between attention, sound-movement synchronization, and pleasure in human listeners.</p>

<p>As I approach the end of my PhD, I am preparing a transition to industry, ideally as a quantitative user researcher or data scientist.</p>
