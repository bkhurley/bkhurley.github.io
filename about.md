## Brian Hurley
*People Research Scientist at Facebook*

### About Me
I am a cognitive scientist turned data scientist with a keen interest in solving practical problems and impacting people and organizations using data. I am a People Research Scientist on Facebook's People Analytics team, where I combine techniques from data science, statistics, and behavioral science to find, grow, and keep Facebook's employee talent. Prior to Facebook, I was a Data Science Fellow at [Insight Data Science](https://insightdatascience.com), where I built end-to-end a web app for predicting crowd levels on Bay Area Rapid Transit, and where I springboarded my transition from academia to data science. 

I completed my PhD in the [Perception, Cognition, and Cognitive Neuroscience](http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/graduate/graduate-program/areas-of-specialization/perception-cognition-and-cognitive-neuroscience) area of the [University of California Davis'](https://www.ucdavis.edu/) Psychology Department, where I worked in the lab of [Petr Janata](https://atonal.ucdavis.edu). My PhD research used body movement recordings, psychophysics, and computational modeling to examine how human listeners perceive and synchronize body movements with the timing structure of rhythmic sounds, namely music. I received my BA from the [University of Texas at Dallas](http://www.utdallas.edu) in the [School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences](http://www.utdallas.edu/bbs/), where I performed research on the perception and memory of musical patterns under the guidance of [Jay Dowling](https://www.utdallas.edu/bbs/faculty/detail.php5?i=171).

When I am not designing experiments, programming, or crunching data, you can find me rolling on two wheels through the hilly roads of the San Francisco Bay Area.
