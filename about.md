## Brian Hurley
*Graduate Student Researcher and PhD Candidate in the [Janata Lab](https://atonal.ucdavis.edu) at the University of California Davis' [Center for Mind and Brain](http://mindbrain.ucdavis.edu)*

### About Me
I am a PhD student in the [Perception, Cognition, and Cognitive Neuroscience](http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/graduate/graduate-program/areas-of-specialization/perception-cognition-and-cognitive-neuroscience) area of the [University of California Davis'](https://www.ucdavis.edu/) Psychology Department. I received my BA from the [University of Texas at Dallas](http://www.utdallas.edu) in the [School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences](http://www.utdallas.edu/bbs/). My PhD research uses body movement recordings, psychophysics, and computational modeling to examine how human listeners deploy their attention to and synchronize their body movements with the sounds that they hear. I typically explore these questions with experiments using music, as music provides a rich acoustic environment that individuals naturally engage with.

I am also keenly interested in predictive analytics, statistical learning, and solving problems with data (check out my data-related side projects [here](https://bkhurley.github.io/projects/)). As part of my journey in transitioning form academia to industry data science, I will join [Insight Data Science](http://insightdatascience.com) in January 2018 as a post-doctoral Data Science Fellow. 

When I am not am not designing experiments, programming, crunching data, or writing my dissertation, you can find me rolling on two wheels through the hilly roads of the San Francisco Bay Area.
