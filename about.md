## Brian Hurley
*Graduate Student Researcher and PhD Candidate in the [Janata Lab](https://atonal.ucdavis.edu) at the University of California Davis' [Center for Mind and Brain](http://mindbrain.ucdavis.edu)*

### About Me
I am a PhD student in the [Perception, Cognition, and Cognitive Neuroscience](http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/graduate/graduate-program/areas-of-specialization/perception-cognition-and-cognitive-neuroscience) area of the [University of California Davis'](https://www.ucdavis.edu/) Psychology Department. My research uses body movement recordings, psychophysics, and computational modeling to examine how human listeners deploy their attention to and synchronize their body movements with the sounds that they hear. I typically explore these questions with experiments using music, as music provides a rich acoustic environment that individuals naturally engage with.

I am also interested in predictive analytics and statistical learning. I apply these techniques in side projects, which you can find [here](https://bkhurley.github.io/projects/).

When I am not am not designing experiments, programming, crunching data, or writing my dissertation, you can find me rolling on two wheels through the hilly roads of the San Francisco Bay Area.

Find me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/bkhurley/) and [Github](https://github.com/bkhurley), or [email](mailto:hurley.brian@gmail.com) me. If you like cycling, you can also find me on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/4699116).
